# ðŸ“° Django Newspaper App

Welcome to my Django Newspaper App! This is a simple yet powerful web app where users can create, read, update, and delete news articles. It comes with user authentication and permission-based access â€” all built using Django.

This project is based on the *Django for Beginners* book by William S. Vincent, which I followed to strengthen my web development and backend skills.
